## Hi there âœ‹!

I'm Tibi!

## About me

I am currently participating in a full-stack web developing course which I am halfway trough. At the moment mostly I consider myself a junior frontend developer who has tons of enthusiasm sucking every bit of knowledge from every platform I am able to use. Right now I am full of motivation becoming a professional developer to acquire my future plans and make something BIG!

## Recent project

|[React-first-project_Car-palace] | [Javascript_practice]
|:-------------- |:-------------- |
| This is my first (for me quite big) project which I could finish. The project itself is a **R**eact project with a **N**ode.js and **E**xpress backend. It was a great way for me to learn and understand the basics of **R**eact. | Little practicing Javascript project tested by my 6 year old son. ps: He loved it! |

## Tech stack and studies

I am halfway trough my one year journey becoming a full-stack web developer at [Webler Education Studio].
So far I know the basics of being a frontend developer. I learned:

 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Bootstrap
 - JavaScript (OOP and Functional programming)
 - Node.js
 - Express
 - React (Functional programming)
 - Version control (git/github)

## Skills

 - Being a sportsman made me extremely durable and persistent and sometimes I feel like an array because these are my key:values :v:
 - If something goes wrong I am not afraid to do a research and solve it myself, but of course if I have the opportunity I like to ask my mentor for help because I know that this is the most efficient and fastest way of solving problems
 - I just simply cannot give up

## Work experience

Sadly I do not have any relevant experience on this field except for my project. I am currently working in a warehouse as a Vice Leader which made me a good teamplayer and helped me increase my loadability. I used to work on the field of sales which taught me how to deal with people and how to ask efficiently to get to the point and I have also learned how to handle deadlines.

## In my free time...

Right now I am mostly studying, secondly playing with my kids and thirdly preparing my future competitions of arm wrestling.:muscle:
